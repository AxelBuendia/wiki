Fog of War is a tool used to easily reveal a zone steps by steps (like the rooms of a dungeon). The areas not revealed by the GM are transparent for the players.

# Enable Fog of War
In the *Scene* dock, find the cog on the right of the name of your scene and click it. Options for the scene will show up, and inside them you should find an option *Fog of War*. Click on the checkbox to enable it.

# Reveal of hide zones
Once the fog of war is enabled on the scene, this one is totally hidden. A new dock, "*Fog of War*" should have appeared, which contains several tools.

The first three tools allow you to reveal zones:
- By polygon: click on each angle you want to create, then double-click to close the shape and reveal the zone
- By rectangle: press down the mouse button to start to draw the zone, and release the button to reveal
- "*All*" allows you to display the whole scene

The 3 tools in *Hide* work exactly the same, but are used to hide zones instead of revealing them.
