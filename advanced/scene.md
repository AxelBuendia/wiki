To change the configuration of a scene, click on the cog on the right of the name of scene, in the *Scene* dock:

# Options
![scene-parameters.png](/medias/scene-parameters.png)

## Name
The name of your scene, so you can find it easily in the *Scene Browser*.

## Dimensions
The width and height of the scene in pixels. If you use the option *Adapt Scene to Image* on an image, those values will be updated according to the size of the image.

## Background color
You can choose the background color (default: white).

## Grid
By enabling this option, a grid will be displayed on top of the scene. Grids are particularly useful in tactical combat.

### Type
There are two types of grids, either squared or hexagonal. Most of the time, the grid type will depend on the system.

### Snap
If you enable this option, tokens and other scenes elements will snap to the grid.

### Color, Opacity
Color and opacity of the grid.

### Size
The size, in pixels, of the grid. Warning: if you decrease too much this value, there is a possibility than the grid won't cover the whole scene, for performance reasons.

## Fog of War
Check this option to enable [fog of war](/en/advanced/fog-of-war).

## Metrics
Metrics are mainly used in combination with rulers. Define how many base units (in cases, or pixels if the grid is disabled) are equals to how many distance units.

## Play when loading
You can choose a [music playlist](/en/how-to/music) that will play when the players enter the scene.
