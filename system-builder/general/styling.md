You can apply several classes to any component. Classes should be separated by a space " ". We use Bootstrap 4 as a base, so any class available in the [bootstrap utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/spacing/), is also available to you. They are very useful for spacing, padding and flex.

That being said, you should try to not change too much the default design of Let's Role. It's especially important if you want your sheet to become officialized.
