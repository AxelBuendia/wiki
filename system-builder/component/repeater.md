A repeater allows you to setup a dynamic list of view. Users can add or remove entries. On a view, a repeater component is like a container that will contain one "readable view" for each item it contains. The "editable view" is initiated and show only to edit or add a new repeated item to the repeater.

# Editable view
The view used to edit the data.

# Readable view
The view used by default to display informations about the entry.
