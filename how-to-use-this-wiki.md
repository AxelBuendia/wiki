# Using Github
If you are not an approved wiki editor the easiest way to create or edit a page is to make a pull request to the [github repository](https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki) of this wiki. Any changes accepted on the github project will be synced with this site every 5 minutes. In order to do this, follow the instructions below.

## Make an edit
### Create a GitHub account
If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/join and create one.

### Fork the project
Once connected, go to https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and click on *Fork* in the top right.

This operation will take a few seconds.

### Make your edits
The *wiki* project has now been cloned in your namespace. Browse the folders to find the file you want to edit. Click on the name of the file to open it:

![github-page-example.png](/medias/github-page-example.png)

Now, click on the small edit icon on the right of *Raw | Blame*. You will end up in a text editor where you can make your edits.

### Data & Syntax
You will notice that the page starts with a list surrounded by *---*. You can change the title of the page here, but you should not edit any other information in this list.

To format the text under the *---*, use the [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Commit the changes
Once your edits are done, scroll until finding the *Commit changes* form. Fill out a title describing the changes made, then click on *Commit Changes*. You can do the same process for several files.

### Make the pull request
The changes you made are now saved, but only on your clone. You will now need to propagate them back to our project. Go back to https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and click on *Pull requests* in the main tabs. Now click on **New pull request**.

Then click on the link **compare across forks**.

In *base repository*, keep LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and in *head repository*, choose your fork (if your github username is *kitten*, choose *kitten/wiki*).

You can see the changes that you made compared to the original file.

Click on **Create pull request**, tell us what you modified in the form, then click again on **Create pull request**.

### Wait for your edits to be validated
The Let's Role [moderators](/en/staff) will proof read your edits, and if everything is alright, accept the pull request. Your edit will appear on the wiki site after acceptance of your pull request. If there is a problem, an explanation comment will be provided to you. 

# Ask for write access
If you've already made a lot of edits with success, or that you are a trusted member of our community, you can contact on of the [moderators](/en/staff) to ask for a direct access to the wiki. You will then be able to edit pages without using github.
