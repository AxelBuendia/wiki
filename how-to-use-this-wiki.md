# Using Github
The easiest way to create or edit a page is to make a pull request to the [github repository](https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki) of this wiki. Any changes accepted on the github project are synced with this site every 5 minutes.

## Make an edit
### Create a GitHub account
If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/join and create one.

### Fork the project
Once connected, go to https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and click on *Fork* in the top right.

This operation will take a few seconds.

### Make your edits
The *wiki* project has now been cloned in your namespace. Browse the folders to find the file you want to edit. Click on the name of the file to open it:

Now, click on the small edit icon on right of *Raw | Blame*. You will end up in a text editor where you can make your edits.

### Data & Syntax
You'll notice the page starts with a list surrounded by *---*. You can change the title of the page here, but you shouldn't edit any other information in this list.

To format the text under the *---*, use the [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Commit the changes
Once your edits are donc, scroll a bit to find a *Commit changes* form. Fill out a title that describe the changes you've made, then click on *Commit Changes*. You can do the same process on several files.

### Make the pull request
The changes you've made are saved, but only on your clone. You now need to propagate them on our project. Go back to https://github.com/LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and click on *Pull requests* in the main tabs. Now click on **New pull request**.

Then click on the link **compare across forks**.

In *base repository*, keep LetsRoleRPG/wiki, and in *head repository*, choose your fork (if your github username is kitten, choose *kitten/wiki*).

You can see the changes that you've done compared to the original file.

Click on **Create pull request**, tell us what you modified in the form, then click again on **Create pull request**.

### Wait for your edits to be validated
The Let's Role moderators will proof read your edits, and if everything's alright, accept the pull request. If there is a problem, a comment will tell you what it is. Once the pull request accepted, your edit should be soon on the wiki site.

# Ask for write access
If you've already made a lot of edits with success, or that you're a trusted member of our community, you can contact on of the moderators to ask for a direct access to the wiki. Then you'll be able to edit pages without using github.
