You can translate your character sheet in any locale using the translation module.

Translations are **not commited**, they are available globally for your sheet.

# Configuration
## Default locale
Choose the langage by default of the sheet.

## Add Custom Message
You can add messages that have not been detected by the import function.

## Import Messages
This function will find all messages available in your sheet and add them to the list of messages. This function will not erase custom messages.

## Message list
This is the complete list of messages that can be translated.

# Add a translation
When adding a translation, all the messages in the message list can be translated.

# Import/Export
To make translation easier, you can export all the translations in CSV format, and reimport later when updated.
