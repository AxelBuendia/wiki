# Roll on click
You can set a dice formula to roll when clicking on the label here. You do not need to set "clickable" when this has a value.

# Clickable
Allow the label to be clicked. Not required if you added a "Roll on click". This is useful when you want to use click events in scripting.

# Droppable in the QuickBar
If checked, the label can be drop'n dropped in the player's quickbar.

# QuickBar label
The title of the element if placed in the QuickBar. If left empty, the title will be the content of the label.
