# Create a new table
In order to create a new table, click on the *My Tables* tab on the website, then click on *Create a new Table*. If you cannot find the game system you wish to play in the list, take a look at [the community systems](https://community.lets-role.com/c/system-builder/17), where you will be able to find game systems created by the community and add them to your list of systems.

# Invite your players
Once your table is created, you can click on its title in the tables list to display additional information. You will find a box *Invite friends* there, with a link that you can give to the people you want to invite. By clicking on this link, your friends will be able to join your table.

# Your first scene
To join your table as GM, click on *Play Now* in the tables list, then on *Join as the Game Master* which will appear in a banner above the character list.

In order to create your first scene, find the *Scene* dock on the screen, then click on *Media Manager*.

## Use a map by a partner
In the *Media Manager*, click on the *Partners Content* tab on the left. Choose a map that you like, and drag'n drop it on the white background of the scene. The picture should appear in the background. You can now close the *Media Manager* and right-click on the picture, and click on *Adapt Scene to Image*. Congratulations, your first scene is ready!

## Upload a map
If you have already a map that you wish to use, click on *Click here to upload media* and browse your hard drive to find the map. Once the picture is selected, it will be automatically uploaded and should appear as a thumbnail in the media list. Drag'n drop this thumbnail on the white background of the scene, and the picture should appear full size on the scene. You can now close the *Media Manager* and right-click on the picture and then click on *Adapt Scene to Image*. Your scene with a custom background is ready!
