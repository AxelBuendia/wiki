# Create a new table
On the website, click on the tab *My Tables*, then click on *Create a new Table*. If you cannot find the game you wish to play here, take a look at [the community systems](https://community.lets-role.com/c/system-builder/17).

# Invite your players
Once your table is created, you can click on its title on the tables list to display more information. Here, you can find a box *Invite friends*, with inside a link you can give to people you want to invite. By clicking on the link, your friends can join the table.

# Your first scene
To join your table as GM, click on *Play Now* in the tables list, then on *Join as the Game Master*.

Find the *Scene* dock on the screen, then click on *Media Manager*.

## Use a map by a partner
In the *Media Manager*, click on the *Partners Content* tab on the left. Choose a map that you like, and drag'n drop it on the white background of the scene. The picture should appear in the background. You can now close the *Media Manager* and right-click on the picture, and click on *Adapt Scene to Image*. Congratulations, your first scene is ready!

## Upload a map
If you've already downloaded a map and wish to use it, click on *Click here to upload media* and browse your hard drive to find the map. Once the picture is selected, it will be automatically uploaded and should appear as a thumbnail in the media list. Drag'n drop this thumbnail on the white background of the scene, and the picture should appear full size on the scene. You can now close the *Media Manager* and right-click on the picture and then click on *Adapt Scene to Image*. Your scene with a custom background is ready!
