# Create a new character

At the very top of the main menu, hit the *My Characters* tab, then *Create a new character* button. You will have to give your character a name, and choose the **game system** you want to use. **Be aware that you need the Game system to be the same as the *Table* you want to join with this character.**

At the moment there is only a few officially supported **game systems** at your disposal, but you can find a lot more in the dedicated *community* section : https://community.lets-role.com/c/system-builder/17

If you find a **game system** you want to use, click the access link (which would be an URL like `https://alpha.lets-role.com/sy/something`), then *Add to my systems*. You may now create a character using this **system**.

# Character sheet
You can access your character sheet directly to fill it without joining any *table*.

## Change a character's name
Click the small editing icon next to your character's name to change it.

## Change skin
You can choose among various skins sheet by using the *Skin* menu on the top right of your character sheet.

## Share a character
If you want to share your character, you can generate a public link, accessible through the *Options* > *Share* menu in the top right of your sheet. You may revoke the public link at any time.
Someone with this link won't be able to edit your character, but will have read access and be able to clone them in their own character library.

## Clone a character
You'll sometimes find useful to create a copy of a character. If needed, simply use the *Options* > *Clone* function, and give the copy a name. Clones are separated characters, meaning that you can edit one without modifying the other.

## Retire a character
If you do not use your character anymore (e.g. your campaign has ended), you can let them rest by selecting *Options* > *Retire*.

# Join a table
Your GM will send you a link looking like this : `https://alpha.lets-role.com/join/something`. By clicking it, you will be able to join the table by selecting your character. Once it is done, the table will appear in your *Tables* list.

## Tables list
By going in *My Tables* tab, you'll get to see every *table* you joined so far. You can add one to your *favorites* by clicking the star next to it's name, and see information such as how many players are connected, the **game system** used or the GM name. Hit the *Play now* button to connect to the table and start playing.

# Player interface
When connecting to the table, you should see a white screen or background image, and some *dock*. Those are interface elements, each with a specific use.

## Character list

On the very left of your screen is the character list. If the associated player is online, there will be a green dot next to their name. You can open or close avatars by clicking on the character's name.
**To access your character sheet, click your own avatar.**

## Chat
You can discuss with the other players and GM through the chat panel. You can also use it to roll dice (see [xxx]).

## Dice Log

Every dice roll made at the table is stored here.

## Journal

The journal enables you to write notes. You can create your own entries by clicking *New entry* on the bottom. By default, your document will only be yours to see or edit, but you can share it with the other players or tables by using share option on the left of the entry window.
