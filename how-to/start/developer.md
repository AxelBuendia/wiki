Let's Role is allowing everyone to create game systems.

# Licence
You are the owner of you systems and can choose the licence you want to apply to them.

# What is a system ?
It is primarily the character sheet used by the players and the potential formulas to calculate stats or dice rolls, but a system can also includes the ability to do crafts (like NPCs, Monsters, Weapons, etc.).

# How to create a new system ?
On the website, click on your avatar in the top right, then click on *My Systems*. Next, click on *Create a new system* and fill out the form.

# Systems sharing
Creating an awesome system is one thing, but sharing it with others is better! In your system, a box titled *Share* will give you a link you can share with others so they can play with your system. If you feel your system is ready to be shared with everyone do not hesitate to post it in Let's Role community forum under the corresponding category.

# System Building
Building a system is a complex topic, with [its own documentation here](/en/system-builder). Enjoy!

A [demo system](https://alpha.lets-role.com/sy/demo) is available to present the creation of a system.<br>
[DnD5 system](https://alpha.lets-role.com/sy/dnd5) is available too.
