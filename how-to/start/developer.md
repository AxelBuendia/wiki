Let's Role allows everyone to create game systems.

# Licence
You are the owner of you systems, and you can choose the licence you wish.

# What is a system ?
It is primarily the character sheet used by the players, but a system also includes crafts (like NPCs, Monsters, Weapons, etc.).

# How to create a new system ?
On the website, click on your nickname in the top right, then click on *My Systems*. Next, click on *Create a new system* and fill out the form.

# Systems sharing
Creating an awesome system is one thing, but sharing it with others is better! In your system, a box titled *Share* will give you a link you can share with others so they can play with your system.

# System Building
Building a system is a complex topic, with [its own documentation here](/en/system-builder). Enjoy!
