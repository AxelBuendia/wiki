Tokens represent entities on the scene, like characters or monsters.

# Add a token to the scene
- For characters, drag'n drop the avatar from the left coloumn to the scene
- For crafts, drag'n drop the craft from the *Content Crafting* dock to the scene

# Tokens options
By right clicking on a token, several options will be available:

## Open character sheet
By double-clicking on the token, or by clicking on *Character sheet*, you will be able to open the sheet linked to the token (if you are authorized to do so by your GM).

## Barres
By clicking on *Bars*, you can configure bars around the token. Usually, bars represent resources linked to the token, like hit points or mana points.

You can add up to 2 bars to each token. To add a bar, check *Enabled* and give a value, a maximum, and a color to the bar. When clicking on *Save & apply*, the bar will appear on your token.

You can edit the value directly by clicking on the number in the bar, then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

### Connected bars
On some systems, you can choose to connect a bar to an attribute on your character sheet. The value and maximum are automatically computed, and editing the value of the bar will also update the character sheet.

## Auras
An aura display a curved text that rotate around the token. Auras are usefull to mark a status, like "Poisoned" or "Hurt".

## Give control
Like any other scene entity, the GM can give the control of the token to another player, that will be able to move and resize the token.

## Add to Turn Order
By clicking on *Add to turn order*, the GM can create a new entry in the turn order for this token.
